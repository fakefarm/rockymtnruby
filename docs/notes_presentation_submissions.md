## 1) Find your motivation

- Want to do it. You need to love and be passionate about your topic.
- Help others do better.
  - Teach a skill that you know well and that others are weak at.
  - Change opinions about something that is hot (or not).
  - Share a story of how something worked out well.
  - Recount how a popular process didn't work for your team.
  - Tell how you learned a hard lesson with your team.


## 2) Investigate your audience.

- Target the message so it will have the maximum impact.
- Does the audience have a diversity in their backgrounds and/or employment (like at OSCON)?
- Ask questions of the organizer:
  - What's the demographic of the attendees?
  - What backgrounds do they come from?
  - What would they want to learn from a session with a title like the one I'm proposing?
- Query Past Attendees:
  - Find people that have attended this event in the past. Maybe you know someone OR you've found someone on a mailing list.
  - Find the event hashtag and ask people on Twitter. How did they like the event?
    - How can I avoid the missteps from past events?
    - How can I mirror the successes of past events?
- Adjust (content) for maximum audience impact. This is the highest form of respect for your audience. You're using their time wisely and choosing the level of materials that will best resonate with them.
  - What is the technical level of the audience? Basic? Advanced?
  - What languages do the audience members primarily program in?
  - What kind of social diversity can I expect of the audience?
  - What age range might I expect?
  - What educational level will audience members typically have?
  - What development languages will the audience typically know?


## 3) Craft a Story.

- Use Freytag's Pyramid as a model:
  - Exposition
  - Rising Action
  - Compication
  - Climax
  - Falling Action
  - Resolution
  - Denouement
- If this is too much, just simplify to:
  - Exposition
    - What are we about to embark on?
  - Climax
    - The peak of difficulty, struggle. Perhaps the solution in motion.
  - Denouement
    - A nice soft conclusion at the end. People feel the liberty to draw their own conclusion. But you've given them a solid answer through your path through this journey.


## 4) Write the Proposal.

- Put it into the conference proposal system.
- Think about the weight of your words. Trim down the length of the proposal and make it more power-packed.
- Brief, but impactful.
  - Lengths:
    - Title: 4-8 words
    - Abstract:
      - Several sentences. 2-4 sentences that describe the technologies, the story, the type, the interactions, the team the background, the era, that this presentation will be focused on.
    - Description:
      - The exposition. The description of the whole talk.
      - This doesn't need to be a full-fledged outline or a script to be read from.
      - Provide a little bit more depth to:
        - Draw someone in who was attracted by the title and thought the Abstract mentioned something they would benefit from.
        - Clarifies just a bit further who the right audience is, and who will benefit the most from the talk.
      - You're making sure that the people who thought they were interested will have a good experience.
- Get inspiration from other proposals. Don't start with a blank slate. Look here for past proposals:
  - http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/grid/public
  - Is it the words they've used? The density of phrases? Or is it the grab they put at the beginning?


## 5) Market your talk.

- Do this after creating and submitting the proposal.
- Get your marketing engine running.
- You want to fill all the seats in your venue.
- Advertise your talk everywhere you possibly can.
  - lanyrd.com
  - Social Media: Twitter, LinkedIn, FB


## 6) Design your talk.

- This isn't the same thing as implementing the slides or code demos.
- Sketch your ideas.
  - Take a constraining approach.
  - Use a small Moleskine notebook and 1 mm felt pen.
  - This seems ridiculous, but it forces you to think in bitesized pieces.
  - No legal-sized paper.
  - Can't do a lot of detail with a felt pen.
  - Size of the notebook forces you to concentrate on the big ideas and to sketch quickly and loosely.
- Linearize at the last possible moment.
  - Defer putting these concepts (Mind Maps, Concepts, bubbles, random notes) in order until the last responsible moment.
  - Just try to collect everything on this topic that would benefit the audience.
  - Go in the organizing phase after there's a good corpus of information. There are 2 levels of organization:
    - Group the ideas by topic. Keep to 3-5 segments.
    - Break each segment into 5, 7, or 10 micro-ideas.
    - Put the micro-ideas in some order that looks like revealing the layers of this complex topics onion-skin.


## 7) Build the talk.

 - This is different than design.
 - Separation between Design and Build is extreme.
 - This can be deferred until late in the overall process.
 - Build a few visuals that cue you and the audience along this story.
 - Example: Kent Beck gave an excellent talk on TDD in Sweden with just 3 slides. The talk went for 45 minutes,
   and it wasn't about the slides. The story was Kent.
 - You are the talk
 - Slides are merely a support
   - With a great story and a great subject, and having thought a lot about the audience, the visuals are merely a cue
     to progress you along the length of your talk.

   - Keep it simple.
     - Don't use that extra piece of clip art. Don't use that 3rd or 4th font.
     - Don't get wrapped up in the selection of colors if that gets in the way of a great story.

   - Color is easy with a little help.
     - http://kuler.adobe.com - Choose color patterns
   - Design is easy, given examples.
     - http://speakerdeck.com
     - Look for Featured Presentations.


## 8) Practice the talk.

  - Practice a couple times.
  - Bring a printed copy in case the technology doesn't work.
  - < 10% practiced their talk.
  - De-Stress
    - You're just having a chat with your audience.
    - You're just having a conversation about a topic with a couple hundred people.


## 9) Seed Satisfaction

  - Place friends in the front row.
  - People who are rooting for you, clap, applaud, and ask questions.
  - The Front Row controls the room.
    - People in the other rows will agree with the front row.


## 10) Just Talk

  - Everyone in the audience wants you to succeed.
  - The audience members are your firends.
  - They came expecting a good outcome.


## 11) Feedback

  - Provide a Feedback channel.
  - Take charge of where people give feedback - route it.
  - Provide your preferred means of speaking with you.
    - Email
    - Twitter handle.
  - Vent and direct the steam.
    - Better than them send it out to the world.
    - The people that don't like you just want to be heard.
      - Acknowledge it.
  - Finish on time.
    - Just a few minutes early, but not too early so that they don't feel that they got their money's worth.
    - Give yourself a 5% margin at the end (for technical difficulties).
    - Invite people to come up to the stage to ask you questions 1:1 - gets more satisfaction points.
