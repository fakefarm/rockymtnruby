## Draft Notes


## 1. iterative development

- demo what iterative development looks like in day to day
- benefits
- let me build fake endpoint and discover what the business really needs before sending eng to build more than necessary.
- it's a faster feedback look b/c frontend can demo and prototype out their content before it becomes real data

## 2. we live in the API age

- agricultural age, industrual age, monolothic app age, API age
- why do what the pros have done. (Welath of the nations says do what you do well. API's are the modern version of that)

## 3. separation means

backend:
- doesn't need to worry about caching
- isn't bound to a single consumption point

frontend:
- faster
- can consume from multiple locations

## 4. There is no single vanilla stack of all JS

- this lets each party pick the tools they want
